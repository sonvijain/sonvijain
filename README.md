### Hi there 👋
My name is Sonvi Jain. I am in my third year at Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women.

- 👩‍🎓 I’m currently studying to become the first female engineer in my family!
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects and hackathons.
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I prefer articles over video tutorials while coding.
